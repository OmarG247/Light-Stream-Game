# Light-Stream-Game
A two player arcade game inspired on the style of Tron: Legacy.

# Try it yourself!
To run it, simply download and execute the file 'Game.exe'.

# To access the source code
Download and install a version of Turing from http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/ OR a version of Open Turing from http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/.

Access the folder Source Files and open the Turing file titled 'RUN THIS.t'.

# How it works
This game was built with very simple user input and loops with a lot of sprites.

# Challenges I ran into
I took the decision to remake this game from the ground up about an hour before it was due. I managed to make a single player game into a two player game with a second level which was not supposed to be there in the final version.

# Why I made it
During this time in high school, I was re-watching the series Tron: Uprising, a TV series made in the same universe as Tron: Legacy, one of my favourite movies ever.

As the final project of my grade 11 Computer Science class, in which they taught us how to use the turing language, mainly graphics, we were assigned to make a large scale game, and that's what inspired me to make this game.
